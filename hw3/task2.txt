Task 2:
(i):
Linear Kernel Average accuracy over 10 measures= 62.28%

Polynomial kernel (degree=5) average over 10 measures= 62.28%

(ii):

Polynomial kernel (degree=5) 
training accuracy= 62.89%
Test set accuracy= 61.41%

Linear kernel
training accuracy= 60.46%
Test set accuracy= 59.82%


Polynomial kernel performs better in terms of training and test accuracy.
Both kernels perform equally well in terms of validation accuracy
